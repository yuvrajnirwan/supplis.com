            question: "Are your supplements 100% authentic?",
            answer: "Absolutely. We bypass middlemen and source directly from official brands and authorized importers. Every product comes with an intact seal and a verifiable scratch code for you to check directly with the manufacturer."

            question: "How long does shipping take?",
            answer: "Orders are dispatched within 24 hours. Standard delivery takes 2-5 business days depending on your location in India. You will receive a tracking link via email and SMS as soon as your order ships."
        },

            question: "What is your return and exchange policy?",
            answer: "We offer a 7-day return policy for items that are delivered damaged, tampered with, or incorrect. Because these are consumable goods, we cannot accept returns for opened or partially used products simply because you didn't like the flavor."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you offer Cash on Delivery (COD)?",

        },
        {
            question: "How can I track my order?",
            answer: "Once your order is shipped, you can track it by logging into your Supplis.com account and visiting the 'My Orders' section. We also email you a direct tracking link from our courier partner."
        },
        {
            question: "The powder clumped up. Is it still safe to consume?",
            answer: "Yes, minor clumping is very common in pre-workouts and some amino acids due to ingredients like Citrulline and Glycerol absorbing moisture. It is 100% safe to consume. Just break the clumps with a spoon or shake it well."
